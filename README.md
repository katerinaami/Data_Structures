# Data_Structures

Team Project

We were given a file containing data about the humidity in Los Angeles that was being collected for some months.
We were asked to create certain data structures in order to sort the data and search for specific values.

Some files are missing since we shared the tasks.

Professors: Aristeides Ilias
